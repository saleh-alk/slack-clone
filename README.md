# About the Project
This project is a full stack clone of slack web application that I made using Ruby on Rails and React. For this project, I created 4 features I thought that were a very important aspect of slack. It's a messaging website that allows multiple users to chat and message in the same workplace (group chat). It also allows anyone in that group to create or delete a specific channel in that workplace. Included in the login page is a demo user to allow anyone to play around with the application without having to signup a new account. After logging in it presents you with a list of workplace that account is in, where you have the option to create a workplace. After the workplace is created their is an option to delete the workplace or to join it. If you choose to join it you will see a list of channels you can click on. After selecting your channel, you can now chat with anyone in the workplace in that specific channel in live time. Finally, you can also add as many users as you want by username.

# Features
One feature I that was new to me was using action cable to broadcast the meassages for multiple users. Implementing that was difficult at first, but after some reading on websockets everything waas simple. Another feature I included was the workplace, where any user can create a space to chat. For each chat I included a channel feature, so each workplace have specific chat groups for different discussions. I also included a form to add other users to the workplace.
